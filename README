# datomic-tester

A simple collection common of Clojure commands created from the datomic tutorial.
Datamic tutorial for Java found here: http://datomic.com/company/resources/tutorial.html

## Usage

For reference only.

I recommend using `vim-fireplace` and `nrepl` to play around with this, just make
sure to run the repl the background first:

```
lein repl
```
